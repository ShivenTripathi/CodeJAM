### Corona Special
#### "Mera naam Mukesh hai, Mai lockdown ke time sutta lene campus kebahar gaya tha..."

A patient Mukesh is infected by pneumonia and is not responding to conventional Treatments, doctorsfear that it is because of the novel corona-virus disease cause by the highly infectious new virus.  Dr Mohan from the IITK HC, belives that a dose of paracetamol with blood transfusion can save the life of Mukesh.  You have to help him.  Dr.  Mohan has a warehouse full of paracetamol, as we all know very well but he does not have blood.  and in the lockdown state he must source the bloodfrom within the campus.  Being a man who does not want to spam the entire mailing list, he wants to only send a mail to those who can donate blood to Mukesh.
- Design an Algorithm that takes the blood group and the RH factor as input, and then writes a Mail to the Students who can donate blood to Mukesh.
- Your algorithm must be contained in a Graphical User Interface.  Since Dr.  Mohan is a boomer and cannot run algorithms from the Command line.
- Hint : Use search.pclub.in
- Use python to create GUI
